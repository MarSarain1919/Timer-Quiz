# Timer-Quiz
A timed quiz on JavaScript topics.

This game was created to test those learning JavaScript. 
There is a countdown starting at 150 seconds with 10 questions to answer. Each wrong answer docks 15 seconds off the timer. At the end of the game, the player can input their initials to the high scores, which are accessible until the page is closed or the scores are cleared out. 

Assignment had to satisfy this criteria:

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
